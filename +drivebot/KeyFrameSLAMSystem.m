% This class implements an event-based estimation system using g2o and
% the barebones for building up a minimal, ideal SLAM system. The system is
% event-based and responds to a sequence of events which are time stamped
% and served in order. To implement your SLAM system, you will need to
% implement various methods which mostly involve working with the graph.
% These methods are initially stubbed out and will generate exceptions if
% you try to call them.
